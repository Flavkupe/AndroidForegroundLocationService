# AndroidForegroundLocationService
I created this repo to share the implementation for an Android Foreground Service that can be used to poll for a user's location while the screen is locked. This can be used as a Unity plugin. I used this with great success for my location-based game, and since it was difficult to figure out the details, I thought it'd be nice to share it.
