# AndroidForegroundLocationService
I created this repo to share the implementation for an Android Foreground Service that can be used to poll for a user's location while the screen is locked.

This service can be built and used without much trouble as a Unity plugin. I used this with great success for my location-based game, and since it was difficult to figure out the details (this was my first time creating such a service), I thought it'd be nice to share it. There isn't too much info online on this sort of thing.

The current implementation has a lot of hardcoded stuff, but I may create a version that is a bit easier to adapt to your own projects if needed.

**DISCLAIMER:**
I'm not an Android developer by trade, as this was done as part of a hobby/passion project, so some of the specifics here might not follow best practices.

**TODO:**
I'll be adding some details on how to use this thing soon.
